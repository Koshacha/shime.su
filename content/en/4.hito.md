  ## About Me
  
  Hello, this is the mind behind shimesu. I am a multidisciplinary designer with a strong focus on brand identity, design systems, 3D design, and prototypes. My work interweaves conceptual and storytelling processes. I received my education in design and continuously work to refine my craft in creating visual narratives.

  ## Vision
  
  My work is a blurring of nostalgia through contemporary design. Nostalgia reveals history and ideas from the past, while being contemporary enables me to experiment with digital technologies. Creating narratives that explore the space between these two areas, the physical past and the digital present, provides me with open territory in which to experiment.
