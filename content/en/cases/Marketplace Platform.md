## Introduction

My first complex project using React.js - a website for a marketplace where users can create accounts, customize their personal profile, create stores, products, promotional posts and jobs, add items to cart and correspond with sellers. In this project I worked exclusively on the Frontend. I was in constant contact with the specialist responsible for the Backend.

## Choosing a Next.js framework

SEO-optimization, availability of every page of the site in search engine results was very important for the customer, that's why Next.js was chosen as the main technology. It has the usual and familiar React.js under the hood and provides convenient work with routing, page creation and SSR.

## Work Progress

During the course of the project, I became familiar with a number of essential technologies and libraries such as:

- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next.js
- Socket for implementing chat (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-websocket>)
- Google Firebase Auth - users can use social networks for registration and or authorization on the site
