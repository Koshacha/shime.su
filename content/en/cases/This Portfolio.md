# This Portfolio Website

## Introduction

This website is my current business card in the world of web development. After my experience with Svelte, I decided to switch to Nuxt to deepen my knowledge of the Vue.js ecosystem and take advantage of the benefits this framework offers. The site serves not only to showcase my work, but also as a platform for learning new approaches and technologies.

## Technology Choices

I chose Nuxt 3 as the foundation. This framework attracted me with its well-thought-out structure, file-based routing, and auto-import system for components, which significantly speeds up development.

The **@nuxt/content** module is used for content management, which makes it easy to create pages and posts from Markdown files. This makes updating the site simple and convenient. Internationalization is implemented with **@nuxtjs/i18n**, providing support for Russian and English languages. Image optimization is handled by **@nuxt/image**.

The entire interface is built with Tailwind CSS, which allowed for the rapid creation of a responsive and modern design.

## Work Process

Work on the project began with designing the structure and migrating content from the old site. I paid attention to creating reusable Vue components and configuring Nuxt modules to achieve the desired functionality. In the process, I delved deeper into the capabilities of Nuxt 3, including its composables and plugin system. The result is a fast and modern website that is easy to maintain and expand.
